## Introduction

The Memory Management System project provides a simulation of memory management techniques used in operating systems. It allows users to create and delete processes, allocate memory for processes, free memory, and convert virtual addresses to physical addresses.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `mmu/`: Contains the source code for the memory management unit.
  - `models/`: Contains the definition of MemoryBlock and Process classes.
  - `strategy/`: Contains different memory allocation strategy implementations.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the memory management simulation.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the project.

## Installation

To use the Memory Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/memory-management-system.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd memory-management-system
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the memory management simulation, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the memory management system.

## Memory Allocation Strategies

The project implements the following memory allocation strategies:

- **First Fit**: Allocates the first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate the process.
- **Best Fit**: Allocates the smallest available memory block that is large enough to accommodate the process.
- **Next Fit**: Similar to First Fit, but starts searching for available memory from the last allocation position.
- **Worst Fit**: Allocates the largest available memory block, which may lead to fragmentation but is useful for certain scenarios.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests.
